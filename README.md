Trupti Anand Abnave, Aaron Gluck, Wes Bailey, Aarav Chandra, Jacob Stauch

## Overview

This is an Android mobile app build using Flutter and Firebase. It is really more of a UI demo than an app at this point.

To view, you will need to:

 1. Clone the repo and load in `Android Studio`
 1. Load any required dependencies
 1. Launch a phone simulator or plug directly into a phone and launch on the device

 You can register a new user with an email address.

 1. The email has to be a valid format, but does not have to be real
 1. The password hs to have 6 or more characters

 Or you can log into an existing account with the following credentials:

 User:      barney@bedrock.com
 Pass:      barney

 Notes:
1. The UI shows hardcoded info, the data does not update from the DB.
1. The QR scanner scans, but does not do anything with the data.
1. Most of the navigation is functional, even if only a mocked version.

# But we had fun doing it!
